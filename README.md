# Procedural Texturing of Solid Wood with Knots

This is the repository of Procedural Knots - a research project about modeling the annual ring pattern around knots in solid wood - presented at SIGGRAPH 2022.
It is implemented as a shader program in PyOpenGL and GLSL.

### Environment
- Python 3.8.7

After installing the necessary packages, run the program:
```
$ python setup/main.py
